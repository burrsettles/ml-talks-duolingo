# ml-talks-duolingo

Example code from Duolingo's internal machine learning dev talk series

This repo contains code and data snippets from an informal "course" I teach at [Duolingo](http://www.duolingo.com). The goal of these internal dev talks is to equip engineers, designers, product managers and others within the company with the core concepts in machine learning, natural language processing, and data analysis which are important for our work.
